# The Planteam App

This projects provides the app component of the PlanðŸŒ±eam System for controlling and monitoring the hardware components. 

## Contributions

This project was a collaborative effort with Kathrin Schnizer.
My contributions lie in embedding and assembling the hardware components and the backend code.
Kathrins contibutions lie in the coding and designing of the front end app.
The system architecture development was a combined effort.

## Getting Started 

1. Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Install Git (https://git-scm.com/)
3. Install the command line tools: `npm install --global expo-cli` Expo CLI is a command line app that is the main interface between a developer and Expo tools (required to develop a React Native Mobile iOS app)
4. Install yarn: 'npm install --global yarn'. Run 'yarn add expo'
5. Open a Terminal in your project's folder and run: yarn add react-native-paper or npm install react-native-paper
6. Create an Expo account: https://expo.io/signup
7. Install the Expo Go App on your iOS and log in with your Expo account

## Getting it Running

Inside the projects directory run: ``expo start`` (if this doesn't work run npm start). Now Expo CLI starts Metro Bundler, which is an HTTP server that compiles the JavaScript code of our app using Babel and serves it to the Expo app. It also pops up Expo Dev Tools, a graphical interface for Expo CLI. Scan the QR Code provided to access the app on your iOS device.


---- it should be working now. Rest currently not necessary ----

To **run** your project, navigate to the directory and run one of the following npm commands:
* ``npm start`` # you can open iOS, Android, or web from here, or run them directly with the commands below.
* ``npm run ios`` # requires an iOS device or macOS for access to an iOS simulator
* ``npm run web``
